#About this Project 

This project presents an optimized AES-128 hardware design tailored for resource-constrained embedded platforms. It features a combinational S-Box (no memory overhead), clock gating for reduced power, and a pipelined, resource-sharing architecture to minimize area. UART integration enables real-time I/O via a PuTTY terminal. Designed for low-power IoT devices, embedded controllers, and edge systems, the implementation balances security, performance, and efficiency.
